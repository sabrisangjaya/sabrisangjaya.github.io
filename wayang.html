			 Dewi [Utari] was supposed to marry Arjuna, for his services to the Wirata kingdom. But Arjuna asked that she be offered to his son Abimanyu instead. She asked Abimanyu if he was still single (at that time he was already married to Siti_Sendari). Abimanyu swore that he was still single and vowed to die if this was false. [Utari] eventually figured out the truth and cursed him to die in the Baratayuda war. With [Utari], Abimanyu fathered [Parikesit]. Abimanyu became the ruler of Plangkawati after defeating Prabu [Jayamurcita], also known as [Angkawijaya], who was attempting to marry Rara_Ireng. Since his birth, he has had the Wahyu Hidayat, which granted him great knowledge. After coming of age, he received the Wahyu Cakraningrat, which made him the father of kings. Abimanyu eventually died in the Baratayuda war, as predicted by [Utari]. He killed Lesmana_Mandrakumara but was in turn killed by [Jayadrata] with the Gyiai Glinggang weapon. In an alternative origin story, he was born from Bima's thigh (hence the name Bimanyu).
